== Monitoring and Management over JMX
Java Management Extensions (JMX) provide a standard mechanism to monitor and manage applications.
Spring Boot exposes the most suitable `MBeanServer` as a bean with an ID of `mbeanServer`.
Any of your beans that are annotated with Spring JMX annotations (`@ManagedResource`, `@ManagedAttribute`, or `@ManagedOperation`) are exposed to it.

If your platform provides a standard `MBeanServer`, Spring Boot will use that and default to the VM `MBeanServer` if necessary.
If all that fails, a new `MBeanServer` will be created.

See the {spring-boot-autoconfigure-module-code}/jmx/JmxAutoConfiguration.java[`JmxAutoConfiguration`] class for more details.
